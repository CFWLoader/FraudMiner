	\subsection{Problems}
	\subsubsection{Cycle Graph} This problem is mentioned by Stanton \emph{et al.}\cite{stanton2012streaming}, and this paper also proposed that the best performing heuristic is a weighted variant of the greedy algorithm. There are there three typical graph streaming orders considered in this page:\newline
	1. Beneath First Search.\newline
	2. Depth First Search.\newline
	3. Random.\newline
	\subsubsection{Inseparable Problem} I tested the use of \textbf{Giraph}\cite{giraph} and found out that it still can not parallelly handle graph though this framework is based on the hadoop\cite{hadoop}.

	\section{Personal heuristics}
	\subsection{Cross adjacency matrix}
	General idea is transform the graph into a table with fixed rows and columns. The links are not only horizonal but vertical. But the main issue is how to handle the cross problem. For example, there are three links between 3 nodes. Once we stored as '1-2-3' then we how to express the direct link '1-3'?

	\subsection{Ideas spring from the output of the 'streaming'}
	Section 1 specifies the requirement of such a streaming graph handling system. And the method\cite{stanton2012streaming} purely considers the partitioning problems. Maybe we should start from the goals and the one of goals is Minimizing the cost of querying. Once we take this goal, we might not treat the partitioning problem so important. It means evenly partitioning the graph is not the key problem, it's the fastly collecting the graph information.
