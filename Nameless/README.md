# Nameless
This is a preliminary project for distributed graph processing system. I haven't found a suitable name for it. So I temporarily call it `Nameless`.<br/>
`Nameless` is assigned for the realization of:
1.  Wrapper of native(C) file API.
2.  Wrapper of native(C) socket API.
3.  Wrapper of native(C) POSIX multi-threading API.
4.  Based on `1`, construct streaming native file APIs for loading big file.
5.  Based on `2,4`, construct streaming net file APIs for handling distributed file.
<br/>`To be continued`

Current Progress:<br/>
